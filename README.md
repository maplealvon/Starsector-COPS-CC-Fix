Compatible with COPS v2.0b, Starsector v0.9.1a

Merge with COPS mod install to apply fix, will override and add some files.

Works by adding a CC hullmod that functions just the same as the original but doesn't check for commission status for non-commission removal. 
Instead it checks for presence of the original and removes that instead to prevent doubling up.
